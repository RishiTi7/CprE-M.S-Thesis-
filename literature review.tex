\section*{Literature Review}

\subsection*{1 Introduction}

The necessity for robust mobile authentication mechanisms is paramount in the digital age, where security breaches and unauthorized access pose significant risks. Traditional authentication methods, while prevalent, exhibit vulnerabilities that compromise security and user convenience. The advent of machine learning (ML) in enhancing authentication processes offers promising avenues for developing more secure and user-friendly systems. This literature review explores advancements in mobile authentication, the application of behavioural biometrics, the integration of machine learning in security, and user behavior analysis on mobile devices, drawing insights relevant to the proposed machine-learning-enhanced jumbled number pad two-key pair authentication system.

\subsection*{2 Mobile Authentication Methods}

Traditional authentication mechanisms, including PINs, pattern locks, and biometrics, form the foundation of current mobile security protocols. However, their vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to shoulder surfing and smudge attacks, are well-documented. Harbach et al. (2016) delve into the usability and security aspects of Android lock screens, highlighting the trade-offs between different authentication methods. Their findings underscore the need for innovative solutions that balance security with user convenience.

\subsection*{3 Behavioural Biometrics in Authentication}

The domain of behavioural biometrics presents a fertile ground for authentication research, leveraging unique user behaviours for identity verification. Studies like that of Mondal and Bours (2013) demonstrate the efficacy of using mouse dynamics for continuous authentication on desktop systems. These methodologies underscore the potential of behavioural biometrics, including keystroke and typing dynamics, in enhancing mobile authentication systems.

\subsection*{4 Machine Learning in Security}

Machine learning models have been increasingly applied to security, particularly in developing adaptive and intelligent authentication systems. Yang et al. (2019) illustrate the use of machine learning in analyzing mouse movement patterns for user authentication, showcasing the potential of ML in detecting nuanced user behaviors. Such applications highlight the capability of ML models to learn and adapt to individual user patterns, offering a personalized layer of security.

\subsection*{5 User Behavior Analysis on Mobile Devices}

Understanding user interaction with mobile devices, especially in the context of authentication, is crucial for developing user-centric security solutions. Gascon et al. (2014) explore the continuous authentication of mobile users by analyzing typing motion behavior, revealing the distinctiveness of typing patterns as a reliable authentication factor. This research supports the premise that detailed analysis of user interactions, such as typing patterns of a two-key pair on a jumbled number pad, can enhance authentication security.

\subsection*{6 Jumbled Keypad Authentication}

While direct studies on jumbled keypad authentication are sparse, related research on dynamic user interfaces and randomized keypad layouts provides valuable insights. Such studies suggest that randomizing UI elements can significantly mitigate risks like shoulder surfing, making it a viable strategy for secure authentication. The proposed project's focus on a machine-learning-enhanced jumbled number pad two-key pair could therefore fill a notable gap in the literature by combining the security benefits of keypad randomization with the personalized security offered by ML-based behavioral analysis.

\subsection*{7 Advanced Behavioral Biometrics Techniques}

The exploration of behavioral biometrics extends beyond keystroke dynamics and mouse movements, incorporating aspects like touch dynamics, swipe patterns, and even cognitive biometric factors such as user response patterns to stimuli. Touchalytics by Frank et al. (2013) introduces a framework for continuous authentication using touch dynamics on smartphones, highlighting the uniqueness of touch gestures across individuals. This research underlines the potential of integrating diverse behavioral biometrics into mobile authentication systems, suggesting that a multifaceted approach to behavioral analysis could enhance the robustness of the proposed jumbled number pad system.

\subsection*{8 Deep Learning in Authentication Systems}

The advent of deep learning has introduced sophisticated models capable of capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional data. Studies such as the one by Feng et al. (2017) on using deep learning for continuous authentication based on biometric data illustrate the superiority of deep learning models in extracting intricate features from raw behavioral data. The application of deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), could be particularly advantageous for analyzing the temporal and spatial dynamics of typing behavior on a jumbled number pad, offering enhanced accuracy in user authentication.

\subsection*{9 User Experience and Security Trade-offs}

The intersection of user experience (UX) and security is critical in authentication system design. Research by Bonneau et al. (2012) provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the security and usability of various authentication methods, offering insights into the complex trade-offs involved. Incorporating UX considerations into the design of the jumbled number pad system, such as optimizing the keypad layout for ease of use without compromising security, could significantly influence user adoption and overall system effectiveness.

\subsection*{10 Adaptive and Context-Aware Authentication}

The concept of adaptive and context-aware authentication systems, which adjust authentication requirements based on contextual risk assessments, presents a forward-thinking approach to security. Riva et al. (2012) discuss the potential of context-aware authentication mechanisms that dynamically adjust security levels. Integrating such adaptiveness into the jumbled number pad system, where the model could modify authentication challenges based on contextual factors (e.g., location, time, previous behavior patterns), could enhance both security and user convenience.

\subsection*{11 Advanced Behavioral Biometrics in Authentication}

To deepen the exploration of behavioral biometrics, research such as Killourhy and Maxion's (2009) benchmarking study on keystroke dynamics offers valuable insights into the effectiveness and challenges of using typing rhythms for authentication. This work highlights the potential variability and uniqueness in individual typing patterns, supporting the hypothesis that behavioral biometrics can offer a high degree of security if accurately captured and analyzed.

\subsection*{12 Machine Learning Techniques in Security}

An extended discussion on machine learning in security could involve a review of deep learning techniques, as these have shown significant promise in pattern recognition and anomaly detection. For instance, AlEroud and Karabatis (2020) discuss the application of deep learning models to detect sophisticated cyber threats, indicating the potential of these models to learn complex user behaviors for authentication purposes. Exploring such advanced ML techniques can provide insights into their applicability and performance in the context of mobile authentication.

\subsection*{13 Psychological Aspects and UI Design in Authentication}

Incorporating research on the psychological aspects of user interactions with security mechanisms, such as the work by Beautement et al. (2009) on user compliance with security policies, can offer a deeper understanding of user behavior in the context of authentication. Additionally, examining studies on the impact of user interface design on security behavior, like those by Wogalter et al. (2002), can shed light on how the design of a jumbled number pad might influence user interactions and security outcomes.

\subsection*{14 User Behaviour Analysis on Mobile Devices (Extended)}

To further elaborate on user behavior analysis, research by Buschek et al. (2015) on touchscreen typing and swiping behavior can be reviewed. Their work provides detailed insights into the nuances of user interaction with virtual keyboards, which can inform the design and analysis of the jumbled number pad in the proposed project.

\subsection*{15 Conclusion}

The literature underscores the evolving landscape of mobile authentication, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and the potential of behavioural biometrics and machine learning in crafting more secure and intuitive authentication solutions. The proposed project, with its focus on a machine-learning-enhanced jumbled number pad two-key pair system, stands at the intersection of these research domains, offering a novel approach to mobile authentication. By leveraging the distinctiveness of user behavior in typing patterns, especially in the context of a jumbled keypad two-key pair, this project aims to contribute to the development of advanced, user-centric authentication mechanisms that prioritize both security and usability.
